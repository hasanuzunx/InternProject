# Land Parcel Visualization Web Application

This is a full-stack web application that visualizes land parcel data on an interactive map using modern geospatial technologies. Developed during my internship at Proven Technologies.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The project aimed to build a prototype system that displays parcel information on a dynamic map interface, with data sourced from geospatial platforms. Additionally, a conceptual smart contract structure was explored to simulate land transaction logic.

## 🗺️ Features

- Visualize parcel data using **OpenLayers** on an interactive React-based map
- Read spatial data from **GeoServer** and **QGIS**
- Developed a full-featured **React.js** frontend
- Built a **Node.js + Express** backend for data serving and API communication
- Explored basic blockchain integration concepts with **Solidity** (not included in this repo)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React.js
- OpenLayers
- Node.js & Express
- GeoServer
- QGIS
- Git
